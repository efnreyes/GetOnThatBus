GetOnThatBus
============

As a user, I want to view all the transit stops on a map
2 points

    On a map, show a pin for each stop from: https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobile-makers-lib/bus.json

As a user, I want to see the name and routes of a stop when tapping its pin
2 points

    Show a callout for each stop that shows the name and routes
        Hint: it would be overkill to show that data in a whole new ViewController, also having to tap through to a new ViewController to get such fundamental information would be a bad user-experience.

As a user, I want to see the map zoomed to Chicago
2 points

    The map should be zoomed such that all pins can be seen
        Hint, you can determine the map region by hand, but challenge yourself: do it programmatically. After all, more bus stops will probably be added in the future.
